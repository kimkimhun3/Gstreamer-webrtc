Regarding the C++ program, currently it is working fine.
But it can accept or do one session or one connection.
For example, during the programming is running such as signaling sever, cpp program, and webb page are running to view the streaming, then when I click disconnect button to stop view the streaming at the HTML side, and connect it again, it can't be establish the new streaming again, until I rerun the CPP program again, look like the cpp is ignoring the connection, look like the CPP can't get the new client ID from the web again.
So I want to solve it, and make it flexible to reconnect after disconnect and the CPP don't have to re run again.
